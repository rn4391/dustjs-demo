<h1>DustJS - Server-Side and Client-Side Rendering</h1>

Clone the repository and run the command
 
<code>npm start</code>

Then in your browser, access

<code>localhost:8888</code>

<p>
As a proof, that the page is rendered server-side and that the list items are visible to search engines, you can view the site using lynx text browser (http://lynx.isc.org/)
<p>
Below is the snapshot from lynx for the hotel-listing page when it is first rendered.
